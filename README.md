#  Ray Tracing (for Linux)

## About project
Graphical ray traycer in C. Renders multi-object scenes with colored lights.

The program displays the image in a window:
  * The arrow buttons switch the camera view.
  * Button ESC closes the window and exits the program.

Each element firstâ€™s information is the type identifier (composed by one or two
character(s)), followed by all specific information for each object in a strict
order such as:
* Ambient lightning: A 0.2 255,255,255
  * identifier: A
  * ambient lighting ratio in range [0.0-1.0]
  * R,G,B colors in range [0-255]
* Camera: C -50.0,0,20 0,0,1 70
  * identifier: C
  * x,y,z coordinates of the view point
  * 3d normalized orientation vector [-1,1] for each x,y,z axis
  * FOV : Horizontal field of view in degrees in range [0,180]
* Light: L -40.0,50.0,0.0 0.6 10,0,255
  * identifier: L
  * x,y,z coordinates of the light point
  * the light brightness ratio in range [0.0,1.0]
  * R,G,B colors in range [0-255]
* Sphere: sp 0.0,0.0,20.6 12.6 10,0,255
  * identifier: sp
  * x,y,z coordinates of the sphere center
  * the sphere diameter
  * R,G,B colors in range [0-255]
* Plane: pl 0.0,0.0,-10.0 0.0,1.0,0.0 0,0,225
  * identifier: pl
  * x,y,z coordinates
  * 3d normalized orientation vector [-1,1] for each x,y,z axis
  * R,G,B colors in range [0-255]
* Cylinder: cy 50.0,0.0,20.6 0.0,0.0,1.0 14.2 21.42 10,0,255
  * identifier: cy
  * x,y,z coordinates
  * 3d normalized orientation vector [-1,1] for each x,y,z axis
  * the cylinder diameter
  * the cylinder height
  * R,G,B colors in range [0,255]

## Requirements for Linux
 - MinilibX only support TrueColor visual type (8,15,16,24 or 32 bits depth)
 - gcc
 - make
 - X11 include files (package xorg)
 - XShm extension must be present (package libxext-dev)
 - Utility functions from BSD systems - development files (package libbsd-dev)
 - **e.g. _sudo apt-get install gcc make xorg libxext-dev libbsd-dev_ (Debian/Ubuntu)**
## Compiling
> ` make `
## Start project
